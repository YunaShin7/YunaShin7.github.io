        I have experience in leadership and truly enjoy assisting those around me in need of help and additional support. I have volunteered for individuals who needed anonymous support with whatever issues and situations arose in their lives. I would not give direct advice, but rather listened to these individuals and hopefully helped them overcome their situations. I was strictly trained to not directly involve myself in their situations or give them advice. I was there to purely listen and give them my full attention. I also have took the initiative to become a member of my school of volunteering over a hundred hours and creating a Foreign Film Club that screens films from all over the world to spread diversity, awareness, inclusivity, cultural awareness, societal awareness, and more. Occasionally, the club’s meetings would feature food or treats or drinks from the film’s country of origin and me and my board members would serve them for further inclusivity and cultural awareness. I have succeeded and successfully gathered over sixty individuals to my club and we have participated in club rushes to continuously advocate for cultural diversity. 

I have also been in interested in crimes both domestic and international therefore I have created a true crime podcast that would help share these stories and fascinate individuals just as these stories had fascinated me. These stories range from black widows, mysterious situations, and many more true crime stories that would have a corresponding and matching background picture and introduction that would excite and immerse the audience to the story. These stories would take from in a voiceover. I would also do collaborations with friends to add more insight and opinion to the stories. I would occasionally have scripts to talk about the story but I would also not have scripts and provide a true and authentic view of the true crime story.
